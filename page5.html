    <h1> <center> Casual Shoes</center> </h1>
    <p> When you don't want to dress too relaxed or too dressy, casual shoes are the way to go!. Casual shoes are a very stylistic way of dressing, and formatting your wardrobe. Also, casual shoes can give you a classy look and still not cause you to look to dressy.

    <p> Coach is considered a high end clothing brand that also specialized in shoes. They have several casual shoe selections, and an example of that is in the above shoe picture. One reason you should choose coach is because they have quality shoe material and are well respected in the casual shoe world. However, they are relatively expensive and can cut a hole in your savings if you can't really afford there wear. Also, they are a brand that offer a broad selection of wear, they have wear that includes alot of there insignia and they also have wear that doesnt include there logo on the outside of the shoe.

      Johnson and Murphy is a premium shoe brand that offers a selection of dress shoes and casual shoes. They are not a very high end brand, they are considered cost effective. There price ranges range from $60-200. Most of there shoes consist of a leather material, which could explain the pricees for some of there high end shoes. However they do offer some leather options for lower price ranges also.

    <h2> Last Thoughts </h2>
    <p>
      My conclusive thoughts are that you should not only invest in just casual shoes but in all of the shoes on the page. However, I do believe that a casual selection in your wardrobe should be a serious priority. Remeber good shoes, take you to good places.
