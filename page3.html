<center><body><font size="4"> The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house. He was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory. Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes  for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas, and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas' business rival.</body></center></font>

   <center> <body> <font size="4">The past decade of sneaker culture has been all about making a statement. But of all these popular brands that continue to make their fair share of noise Nike knows how to create products that live up to their considerable hype. It has more icons in its back catalogue than any other sneaker brand. Still the most recognisable. Still the most wanted. Still the ones to beat!<//body></center></font></p>
